## Introduction
The HBnB application is a full-stack project that implements a lodging and rental system. This documentation serves as a blueprint for the application's architecture, providing insights into the systemâ€™s design, relationships between components, and API interaction.

## High-Level Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture with three primary layers:
- **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interactions through an API.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Manages the core application logic, including users, places, reviews, and amenities.
- **Persistence Layer:** Responsible for data storage and retrieval.

### High-Level Package Diagram
The high-level package diagram visualizes the structure of the system, defining the different components and their interactions.

## Business Logic Layer
The Business Logic Layer contains the core entities of the HBnB system:
- **User:** Represents a registered user who can list places and write reviews.
- **Place:** Represents a property listed for rent.
- **Review:** A review written by a user for a place.
- **Amenity:** Represents additional services or features offered by a place.

### Business Logic Class Diagram
The class diagram defines the attributes, methods, and relationships between these entities.

## API Interaction Flow
This section details how API calls interact with different layers of the system.

### Sequence Diagrams
- **User Registration:** Shows the process of a new user signing up.
- **Place Creation:** Displays the steps for a user to create a new listing.
- **Review Submission:** Illustrates the process of submitting a review for a place.
- **Fetching Places:** Demonstrates how the system retrieves a list of available places based on user criteria.
