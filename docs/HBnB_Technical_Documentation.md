# HBnB Technical Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the HBnB application, focusing on its architectural design, core business logic, and API interactions. The goal is to establish a clear and structured reference for developers implementing and maintaining the system.

## High-Level Architecture
### Overview
The HBnB application follows a layered architecture that consists of the following components:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions and API requests.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Manages the application's core functionalities and rules.
- **Persistence Layer**: Responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.

### High-Level Package Diagram
**Diagram:** (Include a Mermaid.js or UML representation here)

**Explanatory Notes:**
- The **Presentation Layer** consists of RESTful APIs and front-end services.
- The **Business Logic Layer** processes requests and enforces rules.
- The **Persistence Layer** handles data storage and retrieval using ORM-based interactions.

## Business Logic Layer
### Detailed Class Diagram
**Entities:**
- **User**: Represents a registered user with attributes like `id`, `name`, `email`, and `created_at`.
- **Place**: Stores details about a property listing, including `id`, `name`, `location`, `price`, and `owner_id`.
- **Review**: Contains user-generated reviews for places, with fields like `id`, `place_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, and `comment`.
- **Amenity**: Represents available amenities, linked to places.

**Diagram:** (Include a UML class diagram here)

**Explanatory Notes:**
- Users can create multiple places.
- Each place can have multiple reviews and amenities.
- Relationships include associations between `User` and `Place`, `Place` and `Review`, `Place` and `Amenity`.

## API Interaction Flow
### Sequence Diagrams for API Calls
The following sequence diagrams outline the flow of API calls across different layers:

### 1. User Registration
**Diagram:** (Include sequence diagram here)

**Steps:**
1. User submits registration details to the API.
2. API validates input and forwards to Business Logic Layer.
3. Business Logic Layer stores user data in the database.
4. API returns success or error response to the user.

### 2. Place Creation
**Diagram:** (Include sequence diagram here)

**Steps:**
1. User submits place details.
2. API forwards data to Business Logic Layer for validation.
3. Business Logic Layer creates the place record.
4. Database stores the new place.
5. API returns confirmation.

### 3. Review Submission
**Diagram:** (Include sequence diagram here)

**Steps:**
1. User submits a review for a place.
2. API validates the request.
3. Business Logic Layer associates the review with a place and user.
4. Database stores the review.
5. API returns success response.

### 4. Fetching a List of Places
**Diagram:** (Include sequence diagram here)

**Steps:**
1. User requests a list of places with filters.
2. API queries the Business Logic Layer.
3. Business Logic Layer retrieves data from the database.
4. Database returns relevant results.
5. API sends the response back to the user.

## Conclusion
This document provides a structured reference for the HBnB application's technical design. By following these specifications, developers can maintain a clear understanding of the systemâ€™s architecture, entity relationships, and API interactions.
